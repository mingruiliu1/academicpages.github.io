PROJECTS
======
* CNN-based Diagnosis of COVID-19: A Comparative Study on Different Image Preprocessing Methods    
  Mentor: Munib Wober, Visiting Lecturer, Harvard, Cambridge	05/2021 - 08/2021   

  * Studied different preprocessing methods; learned basic concepts of filtering and transformation in the frequency domain, including the use of Wiener filter and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).
  * Designed two preprocessing methods which used different algorithms to enhance or reduce the noise and resize original images; compared the strengths and weaknesses of these two methods.
  * Evaluated the result of classification accuracy of our neutral network with two different preprocessing methods.
  * Disclosed a conference paper.
